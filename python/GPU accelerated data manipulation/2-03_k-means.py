## K-Means
'''
In this notebook you will use GPU-accelerated K-means to find the best locations for a fixed number of humanitarian supply airdrop depots.
'''

## Objectives
'''
By the time you complete this notebook you will be able to:
-Use GPU-accelerated K-means
-Use cuXfilter to visualize K-means clusters
'''

## Imports
'''
For the first time we import cuml, the RAPIDS GPU-accelerated library containing many common machine learning algorithms. We will be visualizing the results of your work in this notebook, so we also import cuxfilter.
'''

import cudf
import cuml
â€‹
import cuxfilter as cxf

## Load Data
'''
For this notebook we load again the cleaned UK population data--in this case, we are not specifically looking at counties, so we omit that column and just keep the grid coordinate columns.
'''

gdf = cudf.read_csv('./data/pop_2-03.csv', usecols=['easting', 'northing'])
print(gdf.dtypes)
gdf.shape
gdf.head()

## K-Means Clustering
'''
The unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm will look for a fixed number k of centroids in the data and clusters each point with its closest centroid. K-means can be effective when the number of clusters k is known or has a good estimate (such as from a model of the underlying mechanics of a problem).

Assume that in addition to knowing the distribution of the population, which we do, we would like to estimate the best locations to build a fixed number of humanitarian supply depots from which we can perform airdrops and reach the population most efficiently. We can use K-means, setting k to the number of supply depots available and fitting on the locations of the population, to identify candidate locations.

GPU-accelerated K-means is just as easy as its CPU-only scikit-learn counterpart. In this series of exercises, you will use it to optimize the locations for 5 supply depots.
'''

##Exercise: Make a KMeans Instance for 5 Clusters
'''
cuml.KMeans() will initialize a K-means instance. Use it now to initialize a K-means instance called km, passing the named argument n_clusters set equal to our desired number 5:
'''

km = cuml.KMeans(n_clusters=5)

## Exercise: Fit to Population
'''
Use the km.fit method to fit km to the population's locations by passing it the population data. After fitting, add the cluster labels back to the gdf in a new column named cluster. Finally, you can use km.cluster_centers_ to see where the algorithm created the 5 centroids.
'''

km.fit(gdf)
gdf['cluster'] = km.labels_
km.cluster_centers_

## Visualize the Clusters
'''
To help us understand where clusters are located, we make a visualization that separates them, using the same three steps as before.
'''

## Associate a Data Source with cuXfilter
cxf_data = cxf.DataFrame.from_dataframe(gdf)

## Define Charts and Widgets
'''
In this case, we have an existing integer column to use with multi-select: cluster. We use the same technique to scale the scatterplot, then add a widget to let us select which cluster to look at.
'''

chart_width = 600
scatter_chart = cxf.charts.datashader.scatter(x='easting', y='northing', 
                                              width=chart_width, 
                                              height=int((gdf['northing'].max() - gdf['northing'].min()) / 
                                                         (gdf['easting'].max() - gdf['easting'].min()) *
                                                          chart_width))

cluster_widget = cxf.charts.panel_widgets.multi_select('cluster')

## Create and Show the Dashboard
dash = cxf_data.dashboard([scatter_chart, cluster_widget], theme=cxf.themes.dark, data_size_widget=True)
scatter_chart.view()
%%js
var host = window.location.host;
element.innerText = "'"+host+"'";

'''
Set my_url in the next cell to the value just printed, making sure to include the quotes and ignoring the button (due to this contained cloud environment) as before:
'''

my_url = # TODO: Set this value to the print out of the cell above, including the quotes.
dash.show(my_url, port=8789)

'''
... and you can run the next cell to generate a link to the dashboard:
'''

%%js
var host = window.location.host;
var url = 'http://'+host+'/lab/proxy/8789/';
element.innerHTML = '<a style="color:blue;" target="_blank" href='+url+'>Open Dashboard</a>';
dash.stop()
