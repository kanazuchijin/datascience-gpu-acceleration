## cuGraph Single Source Shortest Path
'''
In this notebook, you will use GPU-accelerated graph analytics with cuGraph to identify the shortest path from node on the road network to every other node, both by distance, which we will demo, and by time, which you will implement. You will also visualize the results of your findings.
'''
## Objectives
'''
By the time you complete this notebook you will be able to:
-Use GPU-accelerated SSSP algorithm
-Use cuXfilter to create a heatmap of average travel times
'''

## Imports
import cudf
import cugraph as cg
â€‹
import cuxfilter as cxf
from bokeh.palettes import Magma, Turbo256, Plasma256, Viridis256

## Loading Data
'''
We start by loading the road graph data you prepared for constructing a graph with cuGraph, with the long unique nodeid replaced with simple (and memory-efficient) integers we call the graph_id.
'''

road_graph = cudf.read_csv('./data/road_graph_2-09.csv', dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'])
road_graph.head()

'''
Next we load the graph-ready data you prepared that uses amount of time traveled as edge weight.
'''

speed_graph = cudf.read_csv('./data/road_graph_speed_2-09.csv', dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'])
speed_graph.head()

'''
Finally we import the full road_nodes dataset, which we will use below for visualizations.
'''

road_nodes = cudf.read_csv('./data/road_nodes_2-09.csv', dtype=['str', 'float32', 'float32', 'str'])
road_nodes = road_nodes.drop_duplicates() # again, some road nodes appeared on multiple map tiles in the original source
road_nodes.head()
road_nodes.shape
speed_graph.src.max()

## Construct Graph with cuGraph
'''
Now that we have the well-prepped road_graph data, we pass it to cuGraph to create our graph datastructure, which we can then use for accelerated analysis. In order to do so, we first use cuGraph to instantiate a Graph instance, and then pass the instance edge sources, edge destinations, and edge weights, currently the length of the roads.
'''

G = cg.Graph()
%time G.from_cudf_edgelist(road_graph, source='src', destination='dst', edge_attr='length')

## Analyzing the Graph
'''
First, we check the number of nodes and edges in our graph:
'''

G.number_of_nodes()
G.number_of_edges()

'''
We can also analyze the degrees of our graph nodes. We would expect, as before, that every node would have a degree of 2 or higher, since undirected edges count as two edges (one in, one out) for each of their nodes.
'''

deg_df = G.degree()
deg_df['degree'].describe()[1:]

'''
We would also expect that every degree would be a multiple of 2, for the same reason. We check that there are no nodes with odd degrees (that is, degrees with a value of 1 modulo 2):
'''

deg_df[deg_df['degree'].mod(2) == 1]

'''
Observe for reference that some roads loop from a node back to itself:
'''

road_graph.loc[road_graph.src == road_graph.dst]

## Single Source Shortest Path
'''
To demo the Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm, we will start with the node with the highest degree. First we obtain its graph_id, reported by the degree method as vertex:
'''

demo_node = deg_df.nlargest(1, 'degree')
demo_node_graph_id = demo_node['vertex'].iloc[0]
demo_node_graph_id

'''
We can now call cg.sssp, passing it the entire graph G, and the graph_id for our selected vertex. Doing so will calculate the shortest path, using the road length weights we have provided, to every other node in the graph - millions of paths, in seconds:
'''

%time shortest_distances_from_demo_node = cg.sssp(G, demo_node_graph_id)
shortest_distances_from_demo_node.head()

# Limiting to those nodes that were connected (within ~4.3 billion meters because
# cg.sssp uses the max int value for unreachable nodes, such as those on different islands)
shortest_distances_from_demo_node['distance'].loc[shortest_distances_from_demo_node['distance'] < 2**32].describe()[1:]

## Exercise: Analyze a Graph with Time Weights
'''
For this exercise, you are going to analyze the graph of GB's roads, but this time, instead of using raw distance for a road's weights, you will be using how long it will take to travel along the road.

Step 1: Construct the Graph
Construct a cuGraph graph called G_ex using the sources and destinations found in speed_graph, along with length in seconds values for the edges' weights.
'''

G_ex = cg.Graph()
G_ex.from_cudf_edgelist(speed_graph, source='src', destination='dst', edge_attr='length_s')

## Step 2: Get Travel Times From a Node to All Others
'''
Choose one of the nodes and calculate the time it would travel to take from it to all other nodes via SSSP, calling the results ex_dist.
'''

ex_deg = G_ex.degree()
ex_node = ex_deg.nlargest(1, 'degree')

%time ex_dist = cg.sssp(G_ex, ex_node['vertex'].iloc[0])

# limiting to those nodes that were connected (within ~4.3 billion seconds; .sssp uses the max int value for unconnected nodes)
ex_dist['distance'].loc[ex_dist['distance'] < 2**32].describe()[1:]

## Step 3: Visualize the Node Travel Times
'''
In order to create a graphic showing the road network by travel time from the selected node, we first need to align the just-calculated distances with their original nodes. For that, we use the mapping from node_id strings to their graph_id integers.
'''

mapping = cudf.read_csv('./data/node_graph_map.csv')
mapping.head()

'''
We see that the sssp algorithm has put the graph_ids in the vertex column, so we will merge on that.
'''

ex_dist.head()
road_nodes = road_nodes.merge(mapping, on='node_id')
road_nodes = road_nodes.merge(ex_dist, left_on='graph_id', right_on='vertex')
road_nodes.head()

'''
Next, we select those columns we are going to use for the visualization.

For color-scaling purposes, we get rid of the unreachable nodes with their extreme distances, and we invert the distance numbers so that brighter pixels indicate closer locations.
'''

gdf = road_nodes[['east', 'north', 'distance']]
gdf = gdf[gdf['distance'] < 2**32]
gdf['distance'] = gdf['distance'].pow(1/2).mul(-1)

'''
Otherwise, this visualization will be largely similar to the scatterplots we made to visualize the population, but instead of coloring by point density as in those cases, we will color by mean travel time to the nodes within a pixel.
'''
