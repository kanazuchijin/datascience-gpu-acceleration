## DBSCAN
'''
In this notebook you will use GPU-accelerated DBSCAN to identify clusters of infected people.
'''

## Objectives
'''
By the time you complete this notebook you will be able to:
-Use GPU-accelerated DBSCAN
-Use cuXfilter to visualize DBSCAN clusters
'''

## Imports
import cudf
import cuml

import cuxfilter as cxf

## Load Data
'''
For this notebook, we again load a subset of our population data with only the columns we need. An infected column has been added to the data to indicate whether or not a person is known to be infected with our simulated virus.
'''

gdf = cudf.read_csv('./data/pop_2-04.csv', dtype=['float32', 'float32', 'float32'])
print(gdf.dtypes)
gdf.shape
gdf.head()
gdf['infected'].value_counts()

## DBSCAN Clustering
'''
DBSCAN is another unsupervised clustering algorithm that is particularly effective when the number of clusters is not known up front and the clusters may have concave or other unusual shapes--a situation that often applies in geospatial analytics.

In this series of exercises you will use DBSCAN to identify clusters of infected people by location, which may help us identify groups becoming infected from common patient zeroes and assist in response planning.
'''

## Exercise: Make a DBSCAN Instance
'''
Create a DBSCAN instance by using cuml.DBSCAN. Pass in the named argument eps (the maximum distance a point can be from the nearest point in a cluster to be considered possibly in that cluster) to be 5000. Since the northing and easting values we created are measured in meters, this will allow us to identify clusters of infected people where individuals may be separated from the rest of the cluster by up to 5 kilometers.
'''

dbscan = cuml.DBSCAN(eps=5000)

## Exercise: Identify Infected Clusters
'''
Create a new dataframe from rows of the original dataframe where infected is 1 (true), and call it infected_df--be sure to reset the dataframe's index afterward. Use dbscan.fit_predict to perform clustering on the northing and easting columns of infected_df, and turn the resulting series into a new column in infected_gdf called "cluster". Finally, compute the number of clusters identified by DBSCAN.
'''

infected_df = gdf[gdf['infected'] == 1].reset_index()
infected_df['cluster'] = dbscan.fit_predict(infected_df[['northing', 'easting']])
infected_df['cluster'].nunique()

## Visualize the Clusters
'''
Because we have the same column names as in the K-means example--easting, northing, and cluster--we can use the same code to visualize the clusters.
'''

## Associate a Data Source with cuXfilter
cxf_data = cxf.DataFrame.from_dataframe(infected_df)

## Define Charts and Widgets
'''
As in the K-means notebook, we have an existing integer column to use with multi-select: cluster.
'''

chart_width = 600
scatter_chart = cxf.charts.datashader.scatter(x='easting', y='northing', 
                                              width=chart_width, 
                                              height=int((gdf['northing'].max() - gdf['northing'].min()) / 
                                                         (gdf['easting'].max() - gdf['easting'].min()) *
                                                          chart_width))
â€‹
cluster_widget = cxf.charts.panel_widgets.multi_select('cluster')

## Create and Show the Dashboard
dash = cxf_data.dashboard([scatter_chart, cluster_widget], theme=cxf.themes.dark, data_size_widget=True)
scatter_chart.view()
%%js
var host = window.location.host;
element.innerText = "'"+host+"'";

'''
Set my_url in the next cell to the value just printed, making sure to include the quotes:
'''

my_url = # TODO: Set this value to the print out of the cell above, including the quotes.
dash.show(my_url, port=8789)

'''
... and you can run the next cell to generate a link to the dashboard:
'''

%%js
var host = window.location.host;
var url = 'http://'+host+'/lab/proxy/8789/';
element.innerHTML = '<a style="color:blue;" target="_blank" href='+url+'>Open Dashboard</a>';
dash.stop()
